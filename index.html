    <hr/>

    <p>
    A highly motivated and experienced professional with a strong foundation in clinical sciences and
    biomedical engineering, (MBChB, MBIOENG, U.Z), also building a strong technical background in
    mechanical engineering, (BSc Mech Eng, EIT). I am eager to apply a unique blend of clinical insight and
    technical expertise to an entry level industry or internship role, focusing on the installation, maintenance,
    research and development of medical devices. I possess hands on technical  experience, and I have
    strong communication skills. I am also a proactive learner committed to contributing to innovative
    healthcare solutions.</p>
